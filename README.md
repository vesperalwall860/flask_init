To run it with working SocketIO functionality, you should run the gunicorn server using the following command:

```gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 1 wsgi```

And configure your apache VirtualHost as per example:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    ServerAlias www.youdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /path_to_app/project/static
    Alias /static /path_to_app/project/static

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/socket.io            [NC]
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket    [NC]
    RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://127.0.0.1:8080/$1 [P,L]

    ProxyPreserveHost On

    ProxyPass /static !

    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</VirtualHost>
```

Apache here works as a reverse proxy to your gunicorn server.

**WARNING:** eventlet version should be 0.17.4 (actually just not 0.18 and higher) as it's the most stable when working with SocketIO

**WARNING 2:** app requires a running Redis server on localhost:6379
